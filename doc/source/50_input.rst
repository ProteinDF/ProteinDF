 Input files
**************

ProteinDF reads calculation parameters from ASCII text input files. 
The user can use any preferred editor to create and edit the input files.

.. index:: fl_Userinput

The default input file name is ``fl_Userinput``. 
If a file named ``fl_Userinput`` exists in the current directory, 
the program reads the file as an input.

The input file for ProteinDF consists of the following sections:

* MAIN

* MOLECULE

.. note::

  Although the previous versions of ProteinDF categorized the keywords in groups, 
  the current version does not require such grouping. 
  Specify keywords at any arbitrary location."

.. warning::
   
   The input files only accept the default locale (LANG=C). 
   If a Japanese Kanji-code (e.g. UTF-8, EUC, Shift-JIS) is used in input files, 
   the program may not obtain an accurate result. 
   In particular, pay attention to the use of a blank (space) character.

.. warning::
   
   In input files, be sure to use the line feed code in accordance with the user's system. 
   Otherwise, the program may not obtain an accurate result. 
   Most of the UNIX systems use the LF (0x0A) code. 
   Be sure to take an appropriate measure when transferring the files 
   created in a Windows system (line feed code: CR(0x0D)+LF) 
   to UNIX systems via FTP or SFTP.


Syntax
======

Specify the keywords in the following format:

.. code-block:: none
                  
   keyword = value

The keywords are case-insensitive.

The value can be of the following three types:

* A single value

A value which does not contain a blank (space, tab, line feed, etc.) 
can be directly specified as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   
   max-iteration = 100


* A single-line text

A text which does not contain a line feed can be specified 
between brackets (``[ ]``), as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   
   method/nsp/occlevel = [ 1 - 20 ]


* Multiple-line text

Specify a text which contains a line feed between braces (``{``, ``}end``) 
as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   
   geometry/cartesian/input = {
                // molecule1
                N        -1.888000        0.035000       -0.211000
                H        -1.766000        0.945000        0.189000
                H        -1.817000        0.099000       -1.205000
                C        -0.758000       -0.730000        0.287000
                H        -0.893000       -0.915000        1.372000
                H        -0.720000       -1.725000       -0.200000
                C         0.529000        0.065000        0.064000
                O         0.520000        1.294000        0.114000
                O         1.742000       -0.451000       -0.186000
                H         1.692000       -1.400000       -0.203000
   }

.. note::
   
   Any text following double-slash ``//`` to the end of the line is 
   treated as a comment. 
   Any line beginning with a hash ``#`` is also ignored as a comment.

.. note::

  If identical keywords are specified, the latter one overwrites the earlier.

.. note::
   
   The user can add a label by attaching ``@`` after atomic symbols. 
   This function is useful when assigning basis sets to the same element 
   in separate groups.

.. note::
   
   A dummy atom can be specified with ``X``. 
   In that case, specify the electric charge of the dummy atom 
   in the fifth column.


.. index:: basis-set/orbital

basis-set/orbital
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specifies basis sets to all atomic species used for calculation. 
Describe the name of the basis set for each atomic species. 
The names of the assigned basis sets must be previously specified 
in the basis2 file. See Appendix for the basis2 file.


Example
